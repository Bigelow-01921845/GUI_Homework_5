Im a little confused on what to write for this so I am just gonna write both of what I think im supposed to do:

I would give myself this grade for Program Integrity/Design:
4 / 4
4 / 4
4 / 4
4 / 4
4 / 4
2 / 3
3 / 3
0 / 3
3 / 3
2 / 2
2 / 2
0 / 2
2 / 2
Total score: 34/40.

And heres my analysis of my code, just incase im supposed to write that

For the html, I had 2 main blocks in the container, 1 for the Text that displays info about the words
and 1 for the actual board and letter rack.

I applied the css to make everything center of the page and look good.

for the javascript here are the function I implemented:

clear_letter_id(): Clears the letter IDs in the row_obj array.

reset_word(): Empties the Scrabble rack, retrieves new tiles for the rack, updates the HTML for the current word and score, and prepares the drag-and-drop functionality.

prepare_drop(): Makes each tile on the board droppable, handles the drop event, and out of bounds event.

create_board(): Sets up the initial Scrabble board with 7 tiles.

get_board_tiles(): Gets the total number of letters, and generates new tiles for the rack.

calculate_word_score(): calculates the score of the word

word_length(): gets the word length

submit(): Updates the HTML for the last word and last score, Updates the total score and resets the word.
